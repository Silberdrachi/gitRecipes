# Shiro Wat

## Ingredients
* ½ cup oil
* ½ cup chickpea flour
* 2 medium onions pureed
* 1 roma tomato pureed
* 4 cloves of garlic chopped
* 2 tablespoons niter kibbeh Ethiopian spiced clarified butter
* 2 to 2 ½ cups of water
* 3 tablespoons berbere spice
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* ¼ teaspoon sugar
* Salt to taste
* 1 jalepeno chopped (optional)

## Preperation
1. Bring a heavy bottom stockpot to medium heat. Add pureed onions to the dry pan, and saute until they become dry and start to take on color- about 4-5 minutes. Add the oil and berbere spice. Saute for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
1. Next add tomato and chopped garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes more.
1. Now start whisking in about half of the chickpea flour. Gradually start to add about 1 cup of water. Whisk in the remaining chickpea flour and an additional 1 cup of water. Whisk until mixture is very smooth. Add remaining ½ cup of water if you prefer your shiro a little thinner.
1. Heat until the shiro begins to pop (simmer). Then add the niter kibbeh, garlic powder, sugar, and salt to taste, stirring until combined.
1. Simmer for about 5-10 minutes over low heat until the flavors combine and the oil separates slightly from the shiro.
1. Garnish with jalepeno, if desired.
1. Serve with fresh injera.
