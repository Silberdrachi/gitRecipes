# Potato and Leek Soup

## Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 medium onion peeled and diced
* 2 small leeks white and light green parts only, scrubbed and thinly sliced
* 4 ribs celery trimmed and finely diced
* 1 fennel bulb cored and thinly sliced, fronds reserved
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 5 cups water or low-sodium vegetable stock
* 1 pound potatoes scrubbed and peeled (or leave skins on, if you prefer), cut into 1″ cubes
* ½ cup heavy cream optional
* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped sage
* Salt and pepper

## Preperation
1. Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften about 6–7 minutes.
1. Add the celery and fennel and cook for an additional 5 minutes—season with salt and pepper.
1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the thyme, paprika, and garlic powder—Cook for 45 seconds.
1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics. Cook, stirring regularly, for 3–4 minutes.
1. Slowly whisk in the water or stock in 1 cup increments. Whisk after each addition until smooth. Turn the heat to medium-high. Continue adding the liquid and whisking until all the liquid has been incorporated. Taste and season generously with salt and pepper.
1. Once the liquid is bubbly and simmering rapidly, add the potatoes. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes until the potatoes are fork-tender. Taste and adjust the seasonings once more.
1. As the potatoes simmer, prepare the sage oil. Pour the extra virgin olive oil into a small saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Once the oil is hot, add the sage. The oil should bubble as soon as the sage is added. Next, turn the heat to low and allow the oil and sage to bubble lightly over low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Be careful not to burn the sage!
1. Turn off the heat and a sprinkle of salt. Set aside.
1. Once the potatoes are fork-tender, turn off the heat. Spoon the soup into bowls and garnish with reserved fennel fronds. Drizzle the sage oil on top. Enjoy!
