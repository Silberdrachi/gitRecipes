# Beef Tips
 
## Ingredients
* 2 lbs cubed beef stew meat
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil (or canola)
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 cups water
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder (I use fresh garlic)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
* *1 package brown gravy mix (.75 ounce)
* 1 cup water
*For less salt/ lower sodium, leave out the teaspoon of salt and use reduced sodium soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and brown gravy mix.
 
## Preparation
1. In a large skillet over medium-high to high heat, heat 3 tablespoons of oil then add the chopped onion and cook until they are translucent, stirring occasionally. 
1. Add cubed beef to the oil and onions, browning the meat on all sides – it will take about a minute on each side. 
1. After browning the beef, add 2 cups of water, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. 
1. Next add garlic powder, salt and pepper, stir well. 
1. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, COVER and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
1. In a medium size bowl (I use my measuring cup), add the gravy mix and 1 cup water, mix well then pour over beef – stir until well blended. 
1. Increase heat, bringing to a boil while continuously stirring –  it is ready when the sauce slightly thickens.
1. Serve over mashed potatoes, white rice or egg noodles with your favorite steamed vegetable and salad.
