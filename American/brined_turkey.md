# Brined Turkey
 
## Ingredients
### Turkey Brine
* 1 14-16-pound frozen natural, young turkey
* 1 gallon vegetable broth (homemade or canned)
* 1 cup kosher salt
* ½ cup brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
* 1½ teaspoons allspice berries
* 1½ tablespoons candied ginger, chopped
* 1 gallon water, iced
###  Roasting
* 1 red apple, quartered
* ½ onion, quartered
* 1 stick cinnamon
* 1 cup water
* 4 sprigs rosemary
* 6 sage leaves
* Canola oil

## Preparation
1. Two to three days before roasting, thaw the turkey in the refrigerator or in a cooler kept at 38° F, tops.
1. To make the turkey brine: Combine the broth, salt, sugar, peppercorns, allspice, and finger in a large stockpot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolve. Remove from the heat. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate the brine.
1. The eve before roasting, combine the brine and the iced water in a cooler. Place the thawed turkey (guts, neck, and whatnot removed) breast side down in the brine. Seal up the cooler and use it as an ottoman. Target bring time: 12 hours; flip the bird once about halfway through.
1. On roasting day: Heat the oven to 500°F. Remove the bird from the brine and rinse inside and out. Discard brine.
1. Place the bird on a roasting rack and place inside a roasting pan. Pat the bird dry (inside and out) with paper towels.
1. Combine the apple, onion, cinnamon, and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add to the turkey’s cavity, along with the rosemary and sage. Truss, if you like.
1. Lightly coat the bird with canola oil. Roast the bird on the lowest rack of the oven for 30 minutes.
1. Insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the breast and reduce the oven temperature to 350°F.
1. Roast until the thermometer registers 155°F, about 2½ hours.
