# Firecracker Chicken
 
## Ingredients
### Chicken
* 1/4 cup canola oil
* 4 chicken breasts boneless skinless
* Salt
* Pepper
* 1 cup cornstarch
* 2 large eggs beaten
### Sauce
* 1/3 cup buffalo sauce if you like more heat use hot sauce, like Frank's brand
* 1 1/4 cup light brown sugar packed
* 1 tablespoon water
* 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

## Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Cut chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and season with salt and pepper.
1. In separate bowls, place cornstarch and slightly beaten eggs. Dip chicken into cornstarch then coat in egg mixture. I have also found that you can put the cornstarch in a gallon sized bag and shake the chicken to coat.
1. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken until browned. Place the chicken in a 9 x 13 greased baking dish.
1. In a medium sized mixing bowl, buffalo sauce, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, water, salt and red pepper flakes. Pour over chicken and bake for 1 hour.
1. I stirred the chicken every 15 minutes so that it coated them in the sauce.
