# Smoky Cajun Shrimp Orzo

## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves
* 1 pound dried orzo pasta
* 1 (28-ounce) can diced fire roasted tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon salt-free Cajun Spice blend
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 4 cups water
* 1 pound raw large peeled and deveined shrimp, thawed if frozen

## Preperation
1. Coarsely chop 2 tablespoons oregano leaves.
1. Combine 1 pound dried orzo pasta, 1 can diced fire roasted tomatoes and their juices, 1 tablespoon salt-free Cajun Spice blend, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and 4 cups water in a 3 1/2-quart straight sided skillet or Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat.
1. Boil, stirring frequently so that the orzo doesnâ€™t stick, about 8 minutes. Add 1 pound raw large peeled and deveined shrimp and cook until the orzo is al dente and the shrimp are cooked through and opaque, about 2 minutes more. Sprinkle each serving with the oregano.
