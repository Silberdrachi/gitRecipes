* 1 1/2 cups potatoes , cut into 1.2cm / 1/2" cubes

## Preperation
1. Heat oil in a large pot or very deep skillet over medium high heat.
1. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes until onion is translucent.
1. Add Curry Spices and stir for 1 minute.
1. Add the potatoes and stir to coat in the Spices. If the spices start to stick to the bottom of the pot, add a tiny splash of water.
1. Add the chickpeas, tomatoes and vegetable or chicken broth. Bring to simmer then turn down the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked and the sauce has thickened.
1. Adjust salt to taste, stir through scallions/shallots and parsley.
1. Serve with rice - basmati would be ideal, or Coconut Rice if you're wanting to impress. To go all out, add some Easy Soft Flatbreads!
