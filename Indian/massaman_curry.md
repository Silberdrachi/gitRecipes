## Preperation
1. Peel and cut your potatoes into quarters and boil for around 25 minutes.
1. Start by making your paste. Slice up your shallots and lemongrass. Add this to a blender along with your garlic, chilli powder, galangal, ginger, coriander seeds, cumin, star anise, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, kaffir lime leaf, pepper and turmeric. Add a good glug of olive oil. Blend until smooth.
1. Get your rice on (see pack instructions).
1. Once blended into a paste, pour a drizzle of olive oil into a hot wok. Spoon in your Massaman paste and stir. Once you can start to smell the aromas from the paste, pour in your coconut milk. Refill the can with water and pour it into the wok. Bring the pan to the boil and add your chicken, your cooked potatoes, sugar, onion powder, onion and soy sauce. Allow the curry to reduce on a medium-low heat until you have a nice thick sauce.
1. When the curry has reduced, add your peanuts and you are ready to serve on a bed of rice. Top with a sprinkle of peanuts and tuck into this delicious Thai classic.
