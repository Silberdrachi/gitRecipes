# Snickerdoodle Cheesecake Bars

## Ingredients
### Cheesecake Layer:
* 2 (8-ounce packages) of cream cheese, room temperature
* 1 cup of powdered sugar
* 2 large eggs, room temperature
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt

### Crust Layer:
* 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, divided into 1 teaspoon and ½ teaspoon
* 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon of salt
* 2 cups of granulated sugar, divided into ½ cup and 1½ cups
* 1 cup of unsalted butter, very soft
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs, room temperature

## Preperation
STEP ONE: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 9×13 glass baking dish with baking spray (like Baker’s Joy). Set aside.

STEP TWO: In a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer, cream together the cream cheese, powdered sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt for one to two minutes or until smooth. Set the cheesecake mixture aside.

STEP THREE: In a separate medium bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, one teaspoon of cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. Set the dry ingredients aside.

STEP FOUR: In a separate small bowl, stir together ½ cup granulated sugar and the remaining ½ teaspoon cinnamon. Set the cinnamon-sugar mixture aside.

STEP FIVE: In a separate large bowl, cream together on low speed, the unsalted butter and remaining 1½ cups granulated sugar for one to two minutes or until light and fluffy. 

STEP SIX: Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix on low to create the Snickerdoodle dough mixture, just until combined. Do not over-mix.

STEP SEVEN: Press two-thirds of the Snickerdoodle dough mixture into an even layer at the bottom of the pan. You will reserve the remaining dough for the topping.

STEP NINE: Spread the cheesecake mixture into an even layer over the Snickerdoodle layer, then drop pieces of the remaining dough randomly over the cheesecake layer.

STEP TEN: Sprinkle the remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the top of the cheesecake layer.

STEP ELEVEN: Bake for 45 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden and the center has set.

STEP TWELVE: Allow the Snickerdoodle cheesecake bars to cool completely on the counter before slicing and serving.
