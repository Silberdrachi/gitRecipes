# Doner Kebab

## Ingredients
* 500g 5% fat lamb mince (this makes the same size as the video)
* Pinch salt and pepper
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp chilli powder (pick your strength!)
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp black pepper

## Preparation
1. This is really easy! Get a large mixing bowl and add all of the ingredients together. Use your hands to really push and work all the herbs and spices into the lamb meat so it is really well mixed through! Push into a small loaf tin to help it shape a bit if you wish (like I did!) â€¦ place in the fridge for 15 minutes, then bake for 35-40 minutes at 180fan/200c/400f on a raised wire rack if possible to allow for any fat to drip down, until golden brown and lightly charred, of course you can push it further if you wish.
