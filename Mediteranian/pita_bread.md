# Pita Bread

## Notes:
Makes two 1-pound free-form loaves, or about 15 pitas

## Ingredients
1 ½ cups warm water (about 100 degrees).
2 ¼ tsp granulated yeast (1 packet)
2 ¼ tsp salt
3 ¼ cups all-purpose white flour, measured using the Scoop-and-Sweep 
Method, plus another cup of flour for rolling the pitas.

## Preperation
* Add the yeast and salt to the water in a large bowl or a plastic container. You can use cold water if you want the rising to take longer, about 3 or 4 hours instead of 2. Don’t fuss with getting all of the yeast to dissolve.
* Add all of the flour, and without kneading, stir with a wooden spoon. If you’re unable to incorporate all the flour with the spoon, bring the mixture together with wet hands. There is no need to knead! The dough should be wet enough to conform to its container.
* Cover the bowl with a top (make sure its not airtight!), plastic wrap, or a kitchen towel. Let rise at room temperature for 2 hours or more, until it doubles in size. You can try to use the dough right away, but it’s easier to handle once it has been fully refrigerated.
* Twenty minutes before baking, place baking stone in the oven and preheat to 450 or 500 degrees.
* Liberally dust a clean counter with flour. Right before baking, dust the surface of the refrigerated dough with flour as well as your hands, and cut off a 1/2 pound portion of dough. Roll the dough with enough flour so it is not sticky, shape the dough into a ball, and place onto the floured surface.
* Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out an 1/8 of an inch evenly throughout. The thickness and evenness of the dough will determine whether or not the pita will puff—if it is too thick the pita will not puff.
* Using a pastry cutter or a pizza peel, lift dough from floured surface and slide onto pizza peel. Bake the pita for about 5 to 7 minutes until golden and puffed, and continue baking each pita individually. Stack pitas and let cool in a folded cotton kitchen towel.
* Store remaining dough in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
