## Preparation
### Laffa flatbread
1. Combine lukewarm water with sugar and yeast. Set aside for 10 minutes to activate.
1. Mix yeast mixture with flour, salt and olive oil and knead for 5-8 minutes, you can do it by hand or electric stand mixer. Once the dough is ready, leave it to prove for one hour or until doubled in size. (In the winter months I always warm up the metal bowl with running hot water before adding the dough as it speeds up the process).
1. Divide the dough into 6 parts and roll into balls, second prove for 10 minutes. (Dust the dough balls with flour to prevent them from drying out).
1. Roll each ball into a thin circle that fits onto your pan (use flour for dusting) You can use a grill outside your house if the weather is good.
1. Bake the flatbreads on medium-high heated frying or griddle pan. It takes around a couple of minutes on each side.

### Shawarma
1. Begin by preparing chicken thighs, remove the skin and bones from the meat and cut each thigh in half. Marinate the meat in a bowl with half the amount of Lebanese spice blend, 1tbsp of olive oil, juice of half a lemon, 3 minced garlic cloves and 1tsp of minced ginger. Place in the fridge overnight or marinate for at least 2 hours.
1. Poke all the meat onto two metal skewers and place it inside the roasting dish. Place in the middle shelf in the oven and set on the grill setting 200C (392F). Grill for 20 minutes then turn upside down, continue cooking for another 20 minutes. Alternatively, you can grill it in your garden if the weather is nice :)
1. Once the meat is nicely grilled on both sides, remove from the oven and take off the skewer, shred it with a knife ready to serve.
1. Build your Shawarma by topping the bread with salad, meat and sauces, wrap and enjoy, you can also wrap it in paper and tinfoil for more of the street food experience.
