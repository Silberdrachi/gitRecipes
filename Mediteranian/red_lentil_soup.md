# Red Lentil Soup
## Ingredients
* Extra virgin olive oil (I used Early Harvest)
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 carrots, chopped
* 3 tsp dry oregano
* 1 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp rosemary
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
* 2 dry bay leaves
* 1 cup crushed tomatoes (from a can)
* 7 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
* 2 cups red lentils, rinsed and drained
* Kosher salt
* Zest of 1 lemon
* Juice of 2 lemons
* Fresh parsley for garnish
* Crumbled feta cheese to serve, optional

## Preperation
* Heat 3 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil until shimmering but not smoking. Add onions, carrots and garlic. Cook 3  to 4 minutes, stirring regularly. Add spices and bay leaves. Cook for a few seconds till fragrant, keep stirring so spices don't burn.
* Add crushed tomatoes, broth, lentils. Season with kosher salt. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until lentils are fully cooked.
* Remove from heat. If you have the time, let soup cool a bit before using an immersion blender to puree. Pulse a few times till you reach the creamy consitency you are looking for.
* Return soup to heat, and stir to warm through. Add lemon zest, lemon juice, and fresh parsley.
* Transfer soup to serving bowls and top with extra virgin olive oil.
* (Optional)Top each bowl with a generous sprinkle of feta cheese. Serve with crusty bread.
