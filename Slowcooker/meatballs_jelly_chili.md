# Crockpot Meatballs with Grape Jelly Recipe:

## Ingredients
### Meatballs
* 1 pound ground pork
* 1 pound ground beef
* 1 cup bread crumbs
* 2/3 cup finely minced onion
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1/2 cup vegetable shortening (for frying the meatballs)
### Sauce
* 32 ounce bag frozen fully-cooked meatballs or homemade meatballs (see recipe below)
* 1 10 ounce jar of grape jelly
* 1 12 ounce jar of chili sauce

## Preperation
### Meatballs
1. Add the ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, onion, milk, Worcestershire, and egg and mix these together in a large bowl, Next, add salt and pepper to this mixture. Use a large spoon or hands to mix thoroughly.
1. Form this mixture into one inch balls, rolling these into your hands until rounded.  We like to make ours bite-sized, but you can use any size you like. Just remember that these will shrink a bit in size when cooked, so make them slightly larger than what you want.
1. Before the meatballs can be added to the crockpot mixture, they need to be cooked first. You can bake them in the oven or saute them in a pan to get them brown and cooked through.
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
1. Line a rimmed cookie sheet with foil.
1. Put a baking rack over the sheet and arrange meatballs on it.
1. Bake your meatballs for about 20 minutes until browned. Check the internal temperature of the inside of a meatball and make sure it is 155 degrees before removing these from the oven. You can take them out to check, of course, but out them back in if they are not done yet.
1. You can freeze these meatballs ahead once browned to use with the recipe above.
### Sauce & Meatballs
1. Once you have your meatballs, whether frozen or homemade meatballs ones ready and browned, add them to the crockpot with a jar of grape jelly and a bottle of chili sauce. Stir.
1. Cover crockpot and set it on low, cooking this mixture for 4 to 6 hours, Alternately, you may cook on HIGH for 2 to 3 hours.
