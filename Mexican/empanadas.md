# Empanadas

## Ingredients
* 1 tbs olive oil
* 1 small/medium onion, finely chopped
* 12oz (340g) minced beef, seasoned with salt and pepper
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp (smoked) paprika
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1 tsp cumin 2 tsp brown sugar
* 3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* 1/2 cup (12cl) tomato sauce (strained tomatoes/passata)
* 1/2 cup (12cl) water
* 1/2 beef stock cube
* 1/2 sweet potato in small cubes
* 1 cup peas, frozen
* 3 sheets of puff pastry
* 1 egg

## Preperation
1. Heat the olive oil in a skillet and brown the beef with the onion. Use a wooden spatula to separate larger chunks.
1. Add the spices and the sugar. Add the garlic. Toss and sauté for a few more minutes. I tend to sauté the garlic after I've browned the beef just in case my skillet is running a bit hotter than I had anticipated. Burned garlic is not your friend, y'all.
1. Toss the sweet potato cubes into the skillet and stir.
1. Add the tomato sauce, the water, and the beef stock cube. Cover your skillet with a lid and cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes.
1. Add the frozen peas, stir, and put the lid back onto your skillet.
1. When you see that most of the liquid has evaporated, pop off the lid and stir every other minute to make sure the mixture doesn't burn.
1. When all the liquid has evaporated, take your skillet off the heat and let the mixture cool. This is a good time to taste because it's fricking delicious and also because now is the time to add some extra seasoning or maybe even hot sauce if you like some heat. Also, make sure that the potatoes and peas are nice and cooked.
1. Preheat the oven as per the instructions on the puff pastry.
1. Roll out your puff pastry and use a 4" (10cm) cookie cutter or small bowl to cut circles out of the pastry.
1. Scoop a heaped tablespoon of the mixture in the center of your circle and gently fold both sides up. You can put a little bit of water or egg white onto one side to make it seal better. If you're having trouble folding your empanadas, you might be using a bit too much filling.
1. Crimp the ends of your empanadas with a fork or try to fold them as I have valiantly attempted.
1. Beat the egg and brush onto the empanadas to get that lovely golden color.
1. Bake your empanadas as per the instructions on your puff pastry.
1. Success! Serve with avocado sauce.
