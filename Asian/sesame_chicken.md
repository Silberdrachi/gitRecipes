# Sesame Chicken

## Ingredients
### Chicken
* 500g (1.1 lb) chicken breast, cut into small, thin strips
* ½ cup chicken stock
* 3 tbsp white vinegar
* 4 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1½ cup plain flour (all-purpose flour)
* 2 tsp cornflour (cornstarch), dissolved in 2 tbsp water
* vegetable oil for frying
* 1 tbsp sesame seeds

### Sauce
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 garlic clove, finely grated
* 1 egg white
* 1 tsp sesame oil

## Preperation
1. In a large bowl, place chicken and marinade ingredients. Mix thoroughly to break up the egg white. Allow to marinate for 10 minutes.
1. In another bowl, mix together the chicken stock, vinegar, sugar and soy sauce.
1. Place the plain flour in a large tray or bowl. Add the chicken pieces and the marinade and use your hands to pat and press the liquid and flour together around the chicken pieces to form a craggy coating.
1. Fill a wok or saucepan to about 1/3 capacity with the vegetable oil. Heat over high heat. The oil is hot enough for frying at 325°F or 165°C or when a wooden spoon dipped into the oil forms small little bubbles. Shake excess flour from the chicken pieces. Cook chicken pieces in 2 to 3 batches for about 3 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Drain on kitchen paper.
1. In a clean wok or pan over medium heat, add the sauce you made earlier. Simmer for about a minute to allow the sugar to dissolve. Then add the cornstarch mixture. Cook for another half a minute or until the sauce has thickened. Add the chicken pieces and toss until evenly coated. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.
