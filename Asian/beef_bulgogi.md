# Beef Bulgogi

## Ingredients
* ½ medium yellow onion sliced into slivers
* 2 green onions more if you want to garnish your completed bulgogi dish
* 3 cloves minced garlic
* 1/3 cup soy sauce for gluten-free, use Tamari wheat free soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* ¼ tsp red pepper flakes
* 2 pinches black pepper
* 2 tablespoons roasted sesame seeds yellow or black
* Optional: ¼ tsp ginger finely minced
* Optional: Up to a tablespoons of agave syrup or honey for additional sweetness
* Vegetable oil
* 1-1.5 lbs. of thinly sliced rib-eye steak purchased from a Korean market cut into strips. You can also slice your own rib-eye or sirloin steak across the grain in 1/8-inch slices. Partially freezing the beef will help with cutting the bulgogi beef in clean slices.

## Preperation
1. Add the onions, green onions, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, red pepper flakes, pepper, and sesame seeds to a medium bowl. Feel free to add the optional ginger if you would like. Whisk all the ingredients for about 10 seconds.
1. Add the sliced beef to the bowl and gently massage the beef with the bulgogi marinade for approximately 2 minutes.
1. If cooking the bulgogi immediately, allow the beef to soak in the bulgogi marinade for at least 30 minutes before cooking. If you plan on cooking later, cover the bowl in plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator until ready to cook.
1. To cook the beef bulgogi, drizzle 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oi to a hot pan – a cast iron pan works the best.
1. Add the marinated bulgogi to the pan and cook the beef in batches, not to overcrowd the pan. The beef only needs about three minutes to cook. The bulgogi should be cooked through, no medium rare beef.
1. Taste the Korean bulgogi and if you would like it a tiny bit sweeter, drizzle a little bit of agave syrup or honey in the pan. Add the cooked bulgogi back to the pan as well. Stir and cook the beef for about 10 seconds making sure the agave syrup is evenly coating all the pieces.
1. Repeat this process with each batch.
1. Serve the bulgogi with steamed rice.
