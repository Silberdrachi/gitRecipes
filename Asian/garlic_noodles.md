# Garlic Noodles

## Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons butter + 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 6-8 fresh garlic cloves, minced (we always use 8)
* 2 scallions, greens only (thinly sliced)
* 1-2 tablespoons fish sauce
* 1-2 tablespoons oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese
* 8 ounces noodles (see notes)
* fried garlic, for topping

## Preperation
1. Infuse the Butter: Heat a large pot with water and allow it to come to boil, cook the noodles according to package directions, drain and set aside. While the water is boiling, grab a large, non-stick skillet and place it on medium-low heat. Add the butter, oil olive, garlic, and scallions. Let the butter infuse with the garlic for 5-7 minutes, stirring often. The garlic should barely sizzle here, you don't want it to brown.
1. Garlic Noodles: While the garlic is going, grab a small bowl and mix together the fish sauce, oyster sauce, and the sugar. When the garlic is cooked, kick the heat up to medium-high, stir in the prepared sauce; let cook for 30 seconds. Add the prepared noodles and toss with parmesan cheese (yes, parm!) Let the noodles cook for a minute so they soak up all that flavor. Top with fried garlic and serve immediately! That flavor is like NOTHING you'll ever have.
