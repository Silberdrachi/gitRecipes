# Monglian Stirfry

## Ingredients
### Beef
* 1 1/2 lbs flank steak - cut across the grain into 1/4-inch strips
* 3 tbsp cornstarch
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil

### Sauce
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 3 cloves garlic - minced
* 1/4 tsp ginger root - freshly grated (or ginger paste)
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/3 cup hoisin sauce
* 1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 1/2 tsp crushed chili paste or chili flakes

### Vegetables
* 1/2 cup water chestnuts - sliced
* 1 cup bell peppers - chopped
* 1 head broccoli - cut into florets and lightly steamed
* 3 green onions - cut into 1-inch pieces

## Preperation
1.  Toss the strips of beef in the corn starch and let them sit on the cutting board for 15 minutes.
1.  Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan set over medium heat add the vegetable oil.
1.  When the oil is hot, lightly sauté the garlic for a minute, then add the ginger and cook for 30 seconds. Pour the remaining ingredients in the pan and simmer for 5 minutes or until the sauce begins to reduce or thicken. Keep warm while preparing the rest of the ingredients.
1.  In a large skillet set over medium-high heat, add the 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, quickly stir-fry the beef in 2-3 batches. You want it to be nice and crisp on the outsides, but not cooked throughout. Transfer cooked beef to a plate. If the pan has a lot of oil in it, remove all but 1 tablespoon of oil.
1.  Add the vegetables and sauté for 2-3 minutes before returning the beef to the skillet. Add the sauce, stir, and allow everything to cook for an additional 2 minutes before removing from the heat. Serve immediately with a side of steamed rice or your favorite noodles.
