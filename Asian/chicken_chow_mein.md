## Preperation
### Sauce
1. In a small bowl combine, soy sauce, rice vinegar, hoisin, sesame oil, whisk in corn starch until combined, and set aside. 

### Noodles
1. To season the wok, add enough vegetable oil to make a little puddle on the bottom of the wok, set the heat to medium-high, swirling the edges often until it begins to smoke, and immediately discard the oil and wipe down the pan with a paper towel. 
1. Get a pot of water boiling over medium-high heat, and add noodles; boil them for about 10 to 20 seconds, drain and rinse with cold water until completely cool. 
1. Add oil to your wok, heat over medium-high, add your chicken thighs (cook in 2 batches to avoid overcrowding), cook them until they cook all the way through, and remove. Next, add green onions, stir fry them for 30 seconds or until the greens get wilted; then add Â¾ of your chopped garlic and cook until it turns golden brown.
1. Add celery, carrots, cabbage, turn up the heat to high, and stir fry for two minutes or until the cabbage is wilted and begins to char; turn the heat down to medium-high and add your chicken. 
1. Stir fry until the chicken is hot again, about 30 seconds, add bean sprouts, stir fry, add your noodles, and stir fry for about 45 seconds. Add all of your chow mein sauce, stir fry, and toss until completely coated; then add water, stir fry, and repeatedly toss for about one minute or until your noodles are entirely glazed.  
1. Cut the heat and add the rest of your garlic, stir until thoroughly combined, add additional soy sauce to taste if needed. Garnish with green onion and chili oil.
