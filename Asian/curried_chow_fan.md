# Curried Chow Fan

## Ingredients
* 500gms lean beef mince
* an onion
* some garlic
* quarter of a cabbage,
* 3-4 cups of mixed frozen veggies (I use a carrot, corn and pea mix)
* half a cup of rice (uncooked)
* some chilli flakes
* salt
* pepper
* lite soy sauce
* curry powder
* sachet of ‘chow mein’ spice mix (Maggi brand) but it’s not necessary.

## Preperation
1. Cook the mince in a little bit of oil, add the onion and garlic and soften. Add the rice and spices, stir and cook for a minute or so.
1. Add in about 500ml of water. Bring to a boil and then turn down to a low simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cabbage and frozen veggies, stir and cook for another 15 minutes or until rice is cooked through and all moisture is absorbed.
1. Adjust seasoning to taste. Nice and easy, relatively cheap and healthy, and versatile - you could use noodles, a different spice mix, different veggies - whatever you have on hand.
