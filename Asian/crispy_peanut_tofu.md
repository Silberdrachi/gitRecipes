# Crispy Peanut Tofu

## Ingredients
### Tofu
* 14 oz extra firm tofu
* 3 Tbsp tamari or soy sauce (or coconut aminos)
* 1 tsp chili garlic sauce
* 1 tsp toasted sesame oil
* 1 Tbsp maple syrup
* 4-5 Tbsp cornstarch (for crispy tofu! You can try subbing arrowroot, but we haven’t tested it and can’t guarantee the results)

### Peanut Sauce
* 2 ½ Tbsp creamy peanut butter (or other nut or seed butter)
* 2 Tbsp tamari (or coconut aminos, but add more to taste as it’s less salty)
* 1 Tbsp chili garlic sauce
* 1 Tbsp lime juice
* 2 Tbsp maple syrup
* 2 tsp sesame oil

## Preperation
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. Start pressing tofu using a tofu press, or wrap in clean, absorbent towel and set something heavy — like a cast iron skillet or books — on top to press out the moisture. Press for about 15-20 minutes.
1. In the meantime, prepare peanut sauce by combining peanut butter, tamari, chili garlic sauce, lime juice, maple syrup, and sesame oil in a small mixing bowl and whisking thoroughly to combine. Set aside.
1. Cut pressed tofu into 3/4-inch cubes and add to a large plate. Top with tamari or soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, and maple syrup. Gently toss to combine using hands or a spoon. Let marinate 2-3 minutes, stirring/tossing occasionally.
1. Use a slotted spoon or your hands to transfer tofu to a quart-size or large freezer bag. Add cornstarch 1 Tbsp at a time and toss to coat. Continue adding more cornstarch and tossing until tofu is coated in a gummy, white layer (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).
1. Transfer tofu to the prepared baking sheet and bake for about 20-25 minutes, flipping at the 18-minute mark to encourage even baking. It should be firm to the touch, firm on the edges, and slightly browned on the exterior once removed from the oven. Bake slightly longer if needed.
1. Heat a large metal or cast iron skillet (12 inch) over medium heat. Once hot, add tofu and the peanut sauce. Toss to coat. Stirring frequently, sauté the tofu for about 2 minutes, or until the tofu is hot and well coated with peanut sauce.
1. At this point it’s ready to eat! Enjoy as is or with any Asian-inspired dish. We love it with our Mango Curry, Noodle-Free Pad Thai, or these Thai Noodle Bowls!
