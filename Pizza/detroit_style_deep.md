## Preperation

### *Note:*
* For a very crispy bottom crust, it is recommended to let your oven preheat to 500 f° and allow enough time for a pizza stone to come to full temperature. Usually 30+ minutes. Put rack and pizza stone on the bottom shelf of the oven.

### Dough (2+ Hours):
* Bloom yeast in hot watter. Adding a pinch of sugar, then mixing. Let sit 5 minutes to make sure it bubbles.
* Mix together water, yeast, salt, and bread flour in a bowl with a spoon. When the mix forms into a ball and you can no longer mix with a spoon, wet your hand and continue mixing and kneading by hand for 1-2 more minutes.  
  * Alternatively, you can use a stand mixer with dough hook and mix on med-high for 7-8 minutes. 
* Cover the dough with a lid and allow to ferment at room temperature for 30 min. 
* Perform 5-6 strength building folds then round and tuck the dough into a ball to create tension. Cover and ferment at room temperature. Repeat the strength building folds and rounding and tucking. Now, cover and allow to ferment at room temperature for 1 hour. Finally, cover and ferment in the refrigerator for 8-24 hours. 
* Flip dough onto a floured surface and flatten into a rough square shape. Cut dough into 2 equal halves. 
* Oil pans very well with olive oil.  Add a dough half into each pan and use your fingertips to dimple the dough and stretch it into the pans. Cover and allow to proof for about 30 minutes in a warm place, 90F/32C (to achieve this, i heat an oven to it’s lowest setting for 2 minutes, then turn it off). 
* Dock the doughs with your fingertips once more to fully spread into the corners of the pans. Cover again and allow to proof at room temp for 30 more minutes. 

### Sauce (35 Mins):
* Add tomato paste, salt, sugar, dried oregano, basil, and chilli flakes into the 28oz can of crushed tomatoes. 
* Add a large drizzle of olive oil to a nonstick pan over medium heat, then add in minced garlic and saute until just fragrant, about 30-60 sec. 
* Stir in tomato mixture and bring to a simmer
* Cook down for about 10 minutes or until reduced by half and thickened.
* Extra can be put in a jar and stored in the fridge, just bring to room temperature at least before putting on the pizza.

### Assembly: 
* Add 1-2 tablespoons olive oil to steel pizza pan, spread to cover the bottom. Add dough and roll it to coat with oil. 
* Press and stretch dough with fingers to flatten it out towards the edges. You may only be able to stretch it so much before a 15 minute break to let the dough relax. Continue working it after relaxing. Repeating if necessary.
* For Corners - pull from the center with your index and thumb out to the corner edge, stretching to form a point.
* Cover dough completely with sauce, leaving only a small gap between the edge of the pan. (1 generous ladle)
* Evenly distribute cheese, there will be gaps. Be sure to put it all the way to the edge, touching the pan. This is what creates the crust.
* Place pan directly on pizza stone. Maximum contact for heat transfer will result in a cripsy bottom. 
* Cook for 12-14 minutes @ 500 f°, until the cheese crust is dark brown and caramelized.
  * When cooking in a toaster oven, preheat the oven (especially if using a stone), and then cook on bagel mode (or mode to have only the bottom element on) for 14 minutes or until the cheese crust is dark brown and caramelized.
